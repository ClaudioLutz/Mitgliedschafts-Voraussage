# Summary
Added an optional DNN backend that plugs into the existing lead-generation pipeline without changing preprocessing, calibration, or ranking outputs.

# Context / Problem
We need a deep-learning alternative to the current tree-based backends while preserving time-aware splits, calibration, and artifact expectations.

# What Changed
- Added `model_backends/dnn_classifier.py` with a SciKeras-based estimator and Keras model builder.
- Integrated a `MODEL_BACKEND=dnn` path in `training_lead_generation_model.py` and `time_estimation.py`.
- Added optional DNN dependencies in `requirements-dnn.txt` and documented setup and backend selection in `README.md`.
- Added a DNN pipeline smoke test in `tests/test_dnn_pipeline.py` (skips if DNN deps are not installed).

# How to Test
- Base install: `pytest`
- DNN-enabled: `pip install -r requirements-dnn.txt` then `MODEL_BACKEND=dnn pytest`
- Optional runtime check: `MODEL_BACKEND=dnn python time_estimation.py`

# Risk / Rollback Notes
- Risk: TensorFlow/SciKeras serialization or training stability on some environments.
- Rollback: remove `MODEL_BACKEND=dnn` usage, delete `models/dnn_classifier.py`, and drop `requirements-dnn.txt` plus the DNN test and README additions.
