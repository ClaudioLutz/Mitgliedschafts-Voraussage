# Feature Engineering Implementation

This document describes the implementation details for the feature engineering phase of the *Mitgliedschafts-Voraussage* project.

## Implementation Details

### Temporal Features
- **Trend Analysis**: Develop a script to calculate the trend of user activity over various time windows (e.g., 7-day, 30-day).
- **Seasonality Decomposition**: Use statistical methods to decompose time series data and extract seasonal components.
- **Recency Metrics**: Calculate the time since the last user activity for various event types.

### Text Analysis
- **NLP Pipeline**: Implement a spaCy-based pipeline to process text from emails and feedback forms.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to score the sentiment of user feedback.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Apply TF-IDF to identify important keywords in text data.

### Interaction Metrics
- **Ratio Calculation**: Engineer features such as the ratio of purchases to website visits.
- **Rate Calculation**: Calculate the rate of specific actions, such as the number of support tickets created per month.
