# Future Research Directions Implementation

This document describes the implementation details for the future research directions phase of the *Mitgliedschafts-Voraussage* project.

## Implementation Details

### Causal Inference
- **Causal Forests**: Implement a causal forest model to estimate the causal effect of different interventions on membership conversion.
- **Instrumental Variables**: Use instrumental variable methods to identify the causal drivers of membership.

### Reinforcement Learning
- **RL Framework**: Set up a reinforcement learning framework to optimize long-term engagement strategies.
- **Reward Function**: Define a reward function that aligns with the business's long-term goals.

### Graph-Based Models
- **Graph Representation**: Represent users and their interactions as a graph.
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Use a graph neural network to learn from the graph representation and make predictions.
