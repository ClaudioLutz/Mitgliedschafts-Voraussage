# Deployment and Infrastructure Implementation

This document describes the implementation details for the deployment and infrastructure phase of the *Mitgliedschafts-Voraussage* project.

## Implementation Details

### Microservice Architecture
- **Dockerization**: Package the model and its dependencies into a Docker container.
- **API Endpoints**: Create a REST API using Flask or FastAPI to serve model predictions.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
- **Automated Testing**: Configure the pipeline to run unit and integration tests on every commit.

### Scalability
- **Cloud Platform**: Deploy the model to a cloud platform such as AWS SageMaker for scalability.
- **Load Balancing**: Use a load balancer to distribute incoming prediction requests across multiple instances of the model service.

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Monitoring Tools**: Integrate Prometheus and Grafana to monitor model performance and system metrics.
- **Alerting Rules**: Set up alerting rules in Prometheus to notify the team of any issues, such as a drop in model performance or high latency.
