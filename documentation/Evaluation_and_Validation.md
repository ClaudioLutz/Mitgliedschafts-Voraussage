# Evaluation and Validation Implementation

This document describes the implementation details for the evaluation and validation phase of the *Mitgliedschafts-Voraussage* project.

## Implementation Details

### Robust Cross-Validation
- **Stratified Splits**: Implement stratified k-fold cross-validation to ensure that each fold is representative of the overall class distribution.
- **Time-Based Splits**: For time-series data, use a time-based cross-validation strategy to prevent data leakage from the future.

### Fairness Assessment
- **Bias Audit**: Use tools like Aequitas to audit the model for fairness across different demographic groups.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Implement strategies such as re-weighting or adversarial training to mitigate any identified biases.

### A/B Testing
- **Experimentation Framework**: Set up an A/B testing framework to compare the performance of different models in a live environment.
- **Metrics**: Define the key business metrics that will be used to evaluate the results of the A/B tests.
