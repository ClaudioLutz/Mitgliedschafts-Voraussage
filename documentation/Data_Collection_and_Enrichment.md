# Data Collection and Enrichment Implementation

This document describes the implementation details for the data collection and enrichment phase of the *Mitgliedschafts-Voraussage* project.

## Implementation Details

### Expanded Data Sources
- **CRM Integration**: Connect to the CRM database using a secure API to extract customer records.
- **Website Analytics**: Utilize a scheduled job to pull website interaction data from our analytics platform.
- **Social Media**: Use a third-party service to gather social media interaction data.
- **External Demographics**: Purchase and integrate a demographic dataset from a reputable vendor.

### Real-time Data Ingestion
- **Streaming Platform**: Implement Apache Kafka to create a real-time data pipeline for user interactions.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Structure the system to process events as they are received from the Kafka stream.

### Data Quality Monitoring
- **Automated Checks**: Develop a Python script that runs daily to check for missing or anomalous data in the collected datasets.
- **Alerting**: Configure the script to send an email alert to the data engineering team if any issues are detected.
