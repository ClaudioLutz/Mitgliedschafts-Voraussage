# Operational Excellence Implementation

This document describes the implementation details for the operational excellence phase of the *Mitgliedschafts-Voraussage* project.

## Implementation Details

### Automated Retraining
- **Retraining Schedule**: Set up a schedule for automatically retraining the model on a regular basis.
- **Performance Thresholds**: Configure the system to trigger retraining when model performance drops below a certain threshold.

### Versioning
- **Data and Model Versioning**: Use DVC or MLflow to version datasets and models.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure that all experiments are reproducible by tracking all code, data, and model versions.

### Security
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Implement a process for regularly scanning the data pipelines and model endpoints for security vulnerabilities.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit.
